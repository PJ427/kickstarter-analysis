# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project

	Purpose of the task is to provide Lousie, an up and coming playwright, with enough data and information to make a decision about when to launch her crowd funding campaign.

	Louise wants to produce her play "Fever" and to do this she needs funds.  She has estimated a budget of $10,000.00.  She wants to generat her funds through a kickstarter but has asked us to look at the data and give her specific factor to make her kickstarter a success.

## Analysis and Challenges

	The date presented some very useful information such as times to kickoff, better locations, and the better categories.  In addition, there was significant information that siginied success or faliure depending on funds, donations, etc.  

## Results

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

 	Looking at Outcomes Based on Launch Date the most obvious conclusion is that May is definitely the best month to start.  However, an early summer producition (June - July) could have much success.  Late Fall and December should not be considerd due to the chance of failure.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

	Outcomes Based on Goals fortells a different problem.  Louise has determined that she would need 10k to produce her play "Fever".  After running the data, her need for 10k has about a 50/50 chance of succeeding.  

	We know from the data provided that failed campaigns have a higher fundraising goal than successful ones so the news isn't good.  If she could bring her cost down it could increase her chance of success.
  
## Summary

  The data appeard very thorough for what Louise needed.  We were able to determine the timeframe, location, and cost for a successful campaign.
